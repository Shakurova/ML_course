       "      <th>\" . . . because i'm a scientist . \\nthat's what we do ! \" \\n--- dr . alexander mccabe ( bob gunton ) , in response to why he created evil bats . \\nalright folks , stop me if you've heard this one : genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals , assisted by a specialist in the particular animal's field , must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth . \\noh yeah , the military is on their way to bomb the town as well , so they are running short on time . \\nsound familiar ? \\nsuch is the plot of the destination films release of bats . \\ndina meyer stars as the \" bat specialist \" sheila , who is pulled from her research ( along with her annoying sidekick , played with irritating deftness by leon ) in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently . \\nwith the help of the local sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) , a cdc official ( carlos jacott ) , and a scientist ( bob gunton ) , sheila discovers it is indeed bats ( who have been genetically altered by gunton's character to be more aggressive and omnivorous , in order to be used as a military weapon ! ) . \\ni have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film . \\nthere's not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good . \\nin this respect , the film never disappointed me . \\nthis film reaches a level that transcends the \" so bad it's good \" level and borders on the downright insane . \\nthe effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think ) . \\ni challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face . \\nthankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with . \\ndina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers . . . \\nthe latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception . \\nwhile one never really gets the impression that meyer's character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either . \\nshe gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she's nice to look at for an hour and a half . \\nlou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero . \\nalthough when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what's going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats . \\nthe only bad performance in the film is that of leon's . \\nhe is relegated to the \" i'm not sticking around here ! \" \\ncharacter and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays . \\nanyone who can't immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it . \\neven if he hadn't been the villain in just about every film he's ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever . \\nin fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale . \\nif the plot doesn't sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol . \\nan entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor's orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk . \\na government official blows off shelia's instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit . \\na cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it . \\nfinally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it's single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we're lucky to even get kevin smith's dogma ) . \\nthe most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill-conceived bat puppets . \\nwhile the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what's going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key . \\ntherefore we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film . \\nbeing able to see the puppeteer's arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse . \\nafter all of this , if you still decide bats might be the movie for you , don't say you haven't been warned . \\ntrust me when i say that it's a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through . \\ni just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in . \\nshe's definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these . \\n</th>\n",

) with the power of an electrical storm . \\nalmost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel . \\nhere , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene . \\nbranagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character . \\non the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past . \\nhelen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein's surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart . \\nthe rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing . \\nvisually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) . \\nthe spinning camera , the constantly building-up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague-riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley's frankenstein is a wonder to behold . \\nkenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : \" . . all \\ni once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by \\nmy hand . . \" . \\nand the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator's body on fire . \\nthe film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness . \\nand a terrifying last close-up on the creature's smiling face . \\ncan a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ? \\nto whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ? \\nshelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them . \\nfollowing her example , branagh does the same . \\nhis film is a tragic saga about playing god . \\nvictor frankenstein is not an evil man . \\nhe wanted to change the world to the better . \\nin this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions . \\nproduced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film \" dracula \" . \\nin comparison , i can say that \" dracula \" has visuals that even \" frankenstein \" can not live up to . \\nbut when it comes to story , characters and casting , \" frankenstein \" is stronger . \\nbut stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan's \" interview with the vampire \" . \\nalthough the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating . \\nbranagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly's classic novel . \\n</th>\n",

it's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren't for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good-not-great flick . \\n \" a bug's life \" has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it's g-rated and not totally over kids' heads like \" antz \" was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that's completely innocent even when it's also remaining perpetually clever . \\n \" antz \" is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and \" a bug's life \" is more for general consumption , but it's also more entertaining . \\nit broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we've never seen before , and it's take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in \" antz . \" \\nit's also light and clever . \\nthe visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of \" antz \" at least a worthy contender . \\nthe characters are also nicely realized - though watered-down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films . \\nthe lead character , flik ( voiced by dave foley ) , is nothing more than a slightly-less neurotic z from \" antz , \" but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z . instead of gene hackman playing the villain , we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper , the nicely-titled hopper . \\nand for the romantic lead , we don't get spacey sharon stone , but intelligent and hard-to-get julia-louis dreyfuss , who doesn't even come around until the very final frames . \\nnot that the plot's really any better than the one in \" antz \" - it's basically yet another redux of \" the seven samurai , \" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else . \\nwhen flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time-conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season's donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won't screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers . \\nhe runs into a group of \" warrirors \" who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses . \\nthese bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in \" toy story \" : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde-pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick-tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish . \\nthe writers lightly touch on each bug's place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats . \\ngrasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake . \\na small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild-mannered squeal is a scream of death . \\nthe bug city is a modern-day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says \" kid tore off wings . \" \\nand a rainstorm is like a giant flood , with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour . \\naround this , the pixar animators stage several large set pieces , like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year , and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end , a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket . \\nmeanwhile , each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting , something \" antz \" couldn't do , and by the end , over the end credits , \" a bug's life \" pulls it's final punch , out clever-ing \" antz \" with a series of incessantly hilarious faux-bloopers that come just at the right time , when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left , and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money's worth of entertainment . \\nstill , it's no \" toy story . \" \\nthat film , maybe above any animated film i've ever seen , encompassed almost true perfection in story , character , and wit . \\nit proved that it didn't need to brag about it's cutting edge technology to really soar ( it's the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far , but is still the most satisfying ) , and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun . \\nyet \" a bug's life , \" as well as \" antz , \" are still amazing films , and prove without doubt , that if you're gonna make a computer animated film , send it to the guys who created these three flicks , evne if they're not working under the same roof . \\n</th>\n",

in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk , because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover . \\nbut here the fianc ? is a decent , ordinary guy , and although slim would like to feel anger , he cannot . \\nthe fianc ? has done nothing wrong ; the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions , take your pick . \\neight taels has its share of flaws ( the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak ) , but it compensates with insight . \\nwhen odds-and-ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco , she notes resignedly , \" it's all the same . \\nwherever we go , we'll be in chinatown , \" and her straightforward statement expresses much . \\nthere is insight , too , in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds-and-ends' decisions : he to move to america , she to marry a chinese-american . \\nboth their choices were perhaps born of impatience , perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener--and it turns out that both choices were wrong . \\nbut they cannot undo them ; they must live with what they have done . \\nsuch is life . \\nthe movie is tender toward these people , but it offers no false comforts . \\neverything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene , which is the culmination of the love story . \\nslim and odds-and-ends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly , with the muted pop-pop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them , and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss . \\nthe exchange that follows , and what slim then does , is poignant and perfect : with clarity and understatement , we see two people's lives , their heartbreaks and virtues , summed up in a single moment . \\nyes , the film is flawed , but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies . \\n</th>\n",

       "      <th>\" america's sweethearts \" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn't nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . \\nalmost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting \" comic relief \" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) . \\ncrystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . \\n \" america's sweethearts \" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . \\nit's a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation . \\nby the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . \\njohn cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . \\nof the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled \" time over time , \" are far from rosy . \\nwhile eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen's solo films have tanked . \\nto make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a \" visionary \" who purchased the unabomber's cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . \\ndesperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation . \\nlee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . \\nhe enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen's sister , personal assistant and whipping girl . \\nwhat lee doesn't know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness . \\npress junkets are a haven for control freaks . \\nstudios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand . \\ngenerally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel . \\nthe next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . \\nevery 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . \\nthe atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets . \\nrepresentatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . \\nthey get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges . \\nthe \" reporters \" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . \\nplacing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit . \\nthe junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . \\nfor most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press . \\nwhen they do deal with journalists , the \" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters \" premise is de-clawed . \\ngwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions . \\nlee certainly isn't bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . \\nis the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? \\nhell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . \\nall of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in \" america's sweethearts \" is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn't matter because any publicity is good publicity . \\nand thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . \\nso what about the cast ? \\njulia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) . \\ncatherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic . \\nby casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on \" comic relief \" - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks . \\nin supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed \" too broad . \" \\nseth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with . \\ncome to think of it , \" little to work with \" is the operative phrase for this movie . \\nas a hollywood satire , \" america's sweethearts \" is toothless . \\nas a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure . \\nsuch a good cast , such a waste of their efforts . \\nhad it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been \" much ado about nothing . \" \\n</th>\n",

\" \\nthe movie did nothing to stem such remarks . \\nall that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo . \\nof course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary . \\nthe psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally don't laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees . \\n ( \" you were going to be promoted -- but now you're not ! \\nfwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! ! \" ) \\nit's no big surprise terl loses to the humans -- he's an idiot . \\nhe breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book . \\nhe underestimates his enemies , assuming he'll win just because he's smarter . \\n ( he uses the word \" leverage \" like some sort of scientologist mantra . ) \\nnot content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos' language and technology . \\n ( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me . ) \\nhe then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him . \\nno wonder this guy never got his promotion . \\nthe plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention . \\nwhy do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive ?

\\nmy respect for supposed \" lightweight \" action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in \" battlefield earth \" how badly an action sequence can be shot . \\nthis movie is an absolute headache . \\nit's not just the shot selection and editing ; the movie , quite frankly , makes no sense . \\nfor most of \" battlefield earth's \" running time , i just didn't know what was happening . \\nit didn't have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical ( though they certainly are ) -- i really had no idea what the hell was going on . \\nwhen i pieced the plot together later , it didn't look any better . \\nhere's how much of a disaster this is : \" battlefield earth \" is already the worst movie of the year , and it's going to take something really , really inept to top it . \\nthe only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it . \\nin fact , i'd think that hubbard's cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible . \\nthat'll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again . \\n</th>\n",

       "      <th>\" dangerous beauty \" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583 . \\nit is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness . \\ndealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff . \\nthe director , marshall herskovitz , doesn't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation . \\nthe film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe . \\nat this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce . \\nthe film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived . \\nhowever , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment . \\nthe story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy ) . \\nunfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders couldn't get in . \\nveronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider . \\nafter a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her . \\nhowever , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco's world , albeit not as his wife . \\nshe decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite . \\na courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied . \\nat one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants . \\nveronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself . \\nonce she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well . \\nshe is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco . \\ntheir relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco's advances . \\nin many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love . \\n \" love the love , not the man , \" as her mother told her . \\n \" dangerous beauty , \" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice . \\nit has multiple plot lines -- including veronica's adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france's military assistance in venice's battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing . \\nmuch of the film's success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role . \\nknown chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson's ire in \" braveheart \" ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady . \\nshe has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes . \\nthe rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in \" dark city \" have assured him a solid place in hollywood . \\nhe has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas . \\noliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy . \\nplatt is a good actor , but he's just too hard to hate . \\njacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco's uncle . \\n \" dangerous beauty \" is marshall herskovitz's sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film \" jack the bear . \" \\npartnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( \" thirtysomething , \" \" my so-called life \" ) and in the movies ( \" legends of the fall \" ) . \\nhis directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions . \\nhe could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids . \\n \" dangerous beauty \" contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative . \\nherskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly-stylized thriller \" kalifornia \" ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara's dark sci-fi film \" body snatchers \" ( 1994 ) . \\nbazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth-century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery . \\nhowever , the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( \" brazil , \" \" the princess bride \" ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( \" the age of innocence \" ) . \\nthe only problem with \" dangerous beauty \" is that it doesn't stick with you . \\nit's a good story well-told with interesting characters , but it's easy to shrug off once you've left the theater . \\nthe only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions , but it never quite comes off because it's simply too melodramatic and conventional . \\nherskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter , but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion , and like the rest of the film , it carries no real weight , despite the potential severity of the subject matter . \\n</th>\n",

       "      <th>\" flubber \" is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation , and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney . \\nit's the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids , but anyone else will feel left out as it's boring , slow , and incredibly lifeless . \\nwhat could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water , and it's a shame because it could have been a great film . \\nhypothetically , i mean . \\n \" flubber , \" as you probably know , is a remake of the disney classic i never saw , \" the absent minded professor , \" where a , well , absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as \" flubber , \" you know , flying rubber ? \\nthe new one keeps the basic plot , but appears to have added a lot else , like more absent-mindedness on the part of the proffessor , some more villains , and several \" show-stopping \" moments , like a big rumba with the flubber , and some more elaborate setups , none which really make it any better , but instead make it worse . \\nthe basic plot revolves around a college professor , philip brainerd ( robin williams ) , who creates lots and lots of inventions , but is sadly absent minded . \\nin fact , he's forgotten his wedding to the college's president , sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden ) , two times before he forgets it again at the beginning . \\ndoesn't this warrant some kind of mental treatment ? \\nanyway , on his wedding day ( the third one ) , he invents the flubber , which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed , but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in \" the abyss . \" \\nphilip believes that this invention , once fully realized , will save his college , which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon/villain , chester hoenicker ( raymond j . barry ) , which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to . \\nthrough a plot twist , hoenicker's goons , named smith and wesson ( ha ha - what a great sense of humor this film has ) who are played by clancy brown and ted levine ( both who needed the pay check ) , discover it the hard way , and try to steal for hoenicker , who wants it just 'cause he's evil enough . \\na sub-plot involves philip's attempts to win back sara , who's angry at him ( and with good reason ) , but who is being seduced by who is basically philip's belloq , wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald , playing the hysterically suave-yet-unsuave asswhole once again ) . \\nand in another subplot , philip's day-timer robot , weebo ( voiced by the one-and-only jodi benson ) , falls in love with him . \\nyuckity-yuck . \\nwhat's most pathetic about this film is how dull it is . \\nyou don't need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film , which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney , who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry , half-assedly re-mixing classics ( or non-classics ) for distribution to the general public , who sadly eats it all up . \\nearlier in '97 , they released \" jungle 2 jungle , \" an adaptation of a really awful french film , \" un indien dans la ville , \" which , yeah , improved over the original , but not by much . \\ndisney's in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now , only creatively . \\nin the rush to ship out a film for distribution , disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called \" magic . \" \\nsuch scenes as dancing flubber , a flying car , a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber , and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze , delight , or even cause people to laugh . \\ni sat there the entire film stone faced , chuckling perhaps twice , and shaking my head at all the bad jokes . \\nwho could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ? \\ndidn't think so . \\nit doesn't help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable . \\nphilip is not a lovable absent minded professory , just a really dumb man being played by robin williams . \\nwilliams is a brilliant comic actor . . . okay , a brilliant actor in general , but here he's given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something , and other times act sad . \\nthose times , he's not bad . \\nbut what are we supposed to think of a man who's forgotten his wedding thrice ? \\nmaybe it was funny and/or respectable in the 60s . . . \\ni like disney , and i usually enjoy their films , not only animated but live action , and their recent films ( save for \" hercules , \" which was good , but not great ) have been worse than lackluster , they've been pathetic . \\n \" jungle 2 jungle \" is probably the worst film i saw last year . \\n \" flubber \" 's probably second . \\nwhat do they need to do ? \\nperhaps create something new . \\nget writers who can write something that's universally entertaining . \\nfilms like \" the parent trap \" and \" mary poppins \" are films that are live action ( or in the latter case a mix of both ) , but even i can still watch them because they're not only written to be magical to children , but to be fun to adults . \\nwhat's more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn ? \\nand my god , couldn't they have done something else with edie mcclurg ? \\n</th>\n",

       "      <th>yeah , yeah , the advertisements didn't even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook - sex . \\nneve campbell and starship trooper's denise richards getting it on ? \\nok ! \\nyeah , it's a decent two minutes of film erotica , but even if that's your main interest in this film , there's plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes . \\nwild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however . \\nnearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing , or at least curious to see the next turn , throughout the entire movie . \\nbut this fast-paced , razor-sharp turning of events doesn't leave much time to enjoy the surprises . \\nwe start off in a high-class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making . \\nguidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) seems to catch the eye of every student , particularly kelly van ryan ( richards ) , daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts . \\nright off the bat , kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce \" mr . lombardo \" . \\nthe fund-raiser car wash seems the opportune time , particularly when you wash your guidance counselor's jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you'll be soaked from head to toe when you're done . \\non the weekend of the car wash , kelly's attempts at seduction fall flat , and when they do , she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day . \\nnaturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations . \\nbut the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low-class , marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller ( campbell ) comes forth with a near identical story , also involving her trusted guidance counselor . \\npitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians , sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney , ken bowden , played by bill murray . \\nyes , that bill murray ! \\nsound like a good , complete movie ? \\nyes , that alone could have been , but this is just the beginning . \\nin fact , the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film . \\nit is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time . \\nby the time the movie finishes , you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable . \\nunfortunately , with so much going on , you're not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about . \\nthis is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could've been . \\nthe 113 minutes fly by , and although it never feels underdeveloped , this pretzel of storytelling could've been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken . \\nthe acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime-time soap operas , which no , is not a good thing . \\nand it's not just campbell , who happens to hail from the prime-time fox soap \" party of five \" , but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones . \\ndillon , who was so charming in his understated role in last year's in &amp; out , gives the best performance , and murray's surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film . \\nin fact , if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy , even if it was the exact same film , i would actually give it a better grade . \\nthat's how cheezy it comes off . \\nbut aside from these two , the rest offer nothing more than some good eye-full's . \\nin the right hands , wild things could've been a wickedly delightful , scrumptiously twisted thriller , but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting . \\nand what's up with these people passing as high school students ? \\ni realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles , but when i realized it wasn't supposed to be a college they were at , i had to snicker . \\ni won't lie - this is definitely a guilty pleasure . \\nas corny as it is , it's got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a \" b \" for effort . \\nbut if you just want to admire denise richards , go for last year's starship troopers , which was every bit as campy , but a million times better . \\nof course , if seeing her breasts is your most important goal , you'll be right at home with wild things . \\nperhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters . \\n</th>\n",

\\nyour thoughts are _real_ . \\nthey are more _real_ than the physical world , according to the new-age screenplay . \\nso , why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie , and let that run wild ? \\nand then she would appear before you , and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity ? \\nbecause there would be no movie , that+s why . \\nand albert the angel ( played by miscast cuba gooding , jr . ) says bluntly : \" that+s fantasy . \" \\numm . . . \\nif your thoughts are more real than the physical , then fantasy is not fantasy , but real . \\nsurely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that . \\nand if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person , and that your thoughts aren't big enough to sustain you for eternity , well , in all due respect , that's why i don't subscribe to this theology . \\nall due respect . \\nanother idea , based on \" time , ( pause ) , does not exist here ! \" \\nso chris , spend your eternity with annie , as she is on earth , reliving your favorite memories , or hang out with her when she was growing up . \\nyou+ve got eternity : perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out . \\nand forcing her to write \" i still exist \" in her diary , imo , is just too tacky . \\nthere are many other ideas , all of which are a hundred times better than what+s unraveled in the plot . \\nthe great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before , and just come out stale . \\nmost insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects , so when they finally show themselves , he realizes they were with him all along . \\nand when this happens , the film runs in slow motion , as if to build emotion . \\n_gag me with a spoon_ . \\nso the only things for me to like are sciorra+s effective performance , who rises far above this mundane material , and the special effects . \\nplease note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals , i did not enjoy _all_ of them : some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe , everybody floating up and down in invisible strings . \\nit sounds like a joke , but it+s really true : i really tried to block out the dialogue , and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack . \\nmy vote goes to a rare cd called \" never say die \" ( 1981 ) from petra , a christian rock group . \\nit+s pretty good , and they have a song about annie , who commits suicide . \\n ( it+s too late for annie/she+s gone away for good/there+s so much we'd have told her/and now we wish we could/but it+s too late . . . ) . \\nmelancholic , yes . \\ndepressing , yes . \\nbut far more entertaining . . . \\nso , in case you don+t know , let me be straight . \\nsuicide--bad . \\n_don+t do it_ . \\nno . no . no .

       "      <th>you know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man . \\nwhile watching instinct , i couldn't help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies . \\neven beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn't a very good film . \\nit's painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly . \\ni didn't hate it -- it's simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good . \\nbut i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved . \\ni can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it's pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams . \\nthings start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) . \\ncaulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous . \\nthe subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years . \\npowell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it's now caulder's job to find out of he's mentally competent enough to stand trial . \\nthrough a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell . \\neven though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting . \\nas i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he's on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he's not acting , that he's actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas . \\nthe character himself isn't very interesting -- he's just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action . \\ngooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual . \\nthe screenplay , written by gerald di pego and \" suggested by \" a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he's obsessed with his work ) . \\nnonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct . \\nunfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting . \\nturtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct's artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots . \\nfirst , we have the prison warden subplot . \\nthe prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder's progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that's fine . \\nthere's also the prison guard subplot . \\nthe prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he's instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion . \\nthen there's the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man . \\nif some of this stuff sounds familiar , that's because they're all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films . \\nthe evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here . \\nthe offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo's nest had . \\nashton's evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown's in the shawshank redemption . \\nhopkins' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs . \\nand then there's the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film . \\nperhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth . \\nthe message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are \" takers , \" that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas . \\ni can sympathize with that , but only when it's in a compelling film . \\nthis is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards . \\nwhat does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ? \\nif all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today . \\nif the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn't rely on the strength of its actors . \\n</th>\n",

insects , or maybe because it doesn't feature slick one-liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80's . \\nhowever , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made . \\ncorey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life . \\none day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him . \\nher name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion . \\nmaggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another . \\nthey gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover . \\nlucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend . \\nthis is not clear to lucas , however . \\nhe still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen . \\nwe soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally . \\nthey throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie . \\nsurprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school . \\nthe next scene is brilliant . \\nmaggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally . \\nshe tries to talk to him as if nothing happened . \\nhe rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion . \\nin lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters . \\nbut maggie is written smarter than that . \\nshe understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him . \\nnext we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) . \\nhe is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend . \\nwhat's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks . \\nof course anyone with a brain can tell what's gonna happen next . \\ncappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas' relationship . \\nthis begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone . \\nshe's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt . \\nmaggie is charmed by cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body . \\nthis scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires . \\ndesperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room . \\nit's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene ) . \\nlucas finally figures out what's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance . \\nthis causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team . \\nthe last third of the film revolves around this attempt . \\nwhile the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not . \\nthere are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up . \\ndave grusin's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps . \\nlucas is filled with great performances . \\nforget everything you know about corey haim . \\nback in 1986 he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain . \\nkerri green is very appealing as maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her . \\nsheen's cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas . \\nthere are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti's ben , a friend of lucas , whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks . \\nalso turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina , the girl who admires lucas from afar . \\nwhen people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s , you hear john hughes this and john hughes that . \\nlucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so-called classics . \\nbut hopefully , like with heathers and say anything , lucas can begin to find it's own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald . \\nit deserves more than that , but i don't want to be greedy . \\n</th>\n",

ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public . \\na little imagination goes a long way . \\nin richard donner's conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything . \\nhis latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day's work for him . \\nhe combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions . \\nupstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned . \\nlucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since . \\nwhat she doesn't know is that jerry's interest in her is far more than , well , professional . \\nhe goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment . \\nbut when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry's ideas and his limited-circulation \" conspiracy theory \" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice's help . \\none of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills . \\npart of this is a result of the film's slow pace . \\nit takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement . \\nat over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it's running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film . \\ninstead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we're treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite \" black elements \" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill . \\nthey come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time . \\nbig deal , we've seen it all before . \\nwatching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck . \\nnow , when i say it took forever to set up the \" relationship \" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement . \\noh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring . \\nyou see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory . \\nthe two just don't click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he's been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced . \\nthe script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us . \\ndialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening . \\neven gibson's usual gift for ad lib couldn't punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry's theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing . \\nunfortunately , much of what's discussed in the film is not inherently important to what's going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it's never followed through . \\nfor example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station . \\nhe even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man's lungs for chlorine . \\nthis is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him . \\nyou know what happens then ? \\nnothing , zip , nada . \\nno follow-up whatsoever , so what's the significance ? \\nokay , here's another one . \\na couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j . d . salinger novel \" the catcher in the rye \" . \\njerry also has a bunch of copies . \\nwhenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one . \\nleaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we're never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin . \\nnot when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question . \\nthe point becomes totally extraneous . \\noh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? \\nyeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . jonas who may or may not be a bad guy . \\nthat's about it . \\nfor all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he's nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory . \\nyou can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi . \\nthis guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time . \\nokay , here's my theory . \\nthis really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true ! \\nthe government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over . \\n</th>\n",

       "      <th>you'd think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it . \\nthat's a bit more difficult . \\nthe farfetched sci-fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies . \\nif you're not nice to it , you lose . \\ngalaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks's spaceballs was to star wars , an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean-spirited or malintentioned . \\n \" the show's been cancelled , but the journey is far from over . \" \\nthat is the current tagline of \" galaxy quest , \" a star trek - type show that's no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns . \\nit also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show's obsessive fans who never fail to dress in \" galaxy quest \" costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble . \\njason nesmith ( tim allen ) played \" commander peter quincy taggart \" on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do . \\nthe attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt . \\ndane , who played a spock-like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character's cheesy trademark line \" by grabthar's hammer , you shall be avenged \" ( or something like that ) for his die-hard fans . \\none day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of \" galaxy quest \" followers . \\nthey are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia . \\nthey have mistaken the \" galaxy quest \" episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel . \\nthe next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film's only mean-spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris ) . \\nnesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes . \\nnext thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship . \\nof course , they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them . \\nbut after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians . \\ni was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked . \\ntaking shots at both the obvious and not-so-obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody . \\nnothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration . \\nthe highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub's fred a . k . a . tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek . \\nwhile scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell \" i need more power down here captain ! \" , \\nchen's cry for help is more to the tune of \" the core , like , won't take it or something . \" \\nit's a hoot , but it doesn't stop there : weaver , whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman , with his relentlessly holier-than-thou attitude aren't far behind . \\ngalaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it's not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments -- it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season . \\nby grabthar's hammer , this is a hell of a movie . \\n</th>\n",

       "      <th>you've got to love disney . \\nno matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it's animated . \\nkids have to go see the movie . \\nthen they have to get the toys . \\noh , the video came out ? \\ngot to buy it , or risk little billy's temper tantrums for the next month . \\nall of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom . \\nstay at the disneyland hotel ! \\nbuy a disney t-shirt ! \\neat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! \\nit's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it . \\ndale carnegie should have had it so good . \\nwhat's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality . \\nyou see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot . \\nthe theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not . \\nthe plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same . \\nhowever , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer . \\nluckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula . \\nthe film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) . \\nsoon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense . \\nwhen the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household . \\nfearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army . \\nmulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling . \\nmulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that \" grace \" is not one of her strong points . \\nvery early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task . \\nby leaving home to fight in her father's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too . \\nas is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film . \\ni'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time . \\nboth lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan's army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga's voice translates much better to animation . \\nyou have to hear it to understand . \\ninterestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan . \\nthere is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie . \\nit is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing . \\nartistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically \" disneyfied \" ethnic tale . \\nthere are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu's hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast . \\nthe other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it . \\nwhen mulan resolves to take her father's place , she dons her father's old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword . \\nas she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal . \\nit just left me thinking , \" that was really cool . \" \\na wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang's conscripted army . \\neven more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan . \\nalthough an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance . \\ni found the choice of b . d . \\nwong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short's wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything's possible . \\nin any event , wong performs admirably as well . \\none character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa . \\nshe deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people . \\njune foray , who supplies grandmother fa's speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) . \\nmarni nixon , who provides grandmother fa's singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady . \\nwith this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history . \\nmulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films . \\nin an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a \" miss saigon \" -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles . \\nin addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei . \\ni guess clyde kusatsu wasn't available . \\nat a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults . \\nthis is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better . \\n</th>\n",

\\nyuck . \\nthe movie itself deserves your attention . \\nfor sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down . \\nonly mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i'll give maximum risk the edge simply because it's not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution . \\nmuch to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero . \\nhis track record isn't as solid as schwarzenegger's , but he's a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold . \\nin 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong's premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target . \\n ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo's radically different director's cut is much better than what was eventually released . ) \\nthis follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo's more operatic offerings . \\nthe surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo's subsequent broken arrow . \\nhere's the rundown . \\nvan damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that's alain's exact double . \\nturns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops ) . \\nalain does some investigating . \\nhe finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia . \\nassuming michael's identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael's girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa . \\nthat's as much as you need to know . \\nthe story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment . \\nthere's a love story , too , but i didn't find it terribly convincing , partly because ex-model henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species ) . \\nshe's great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can't really be described as \" acting . \" \\nof course , \" acting \" isn't really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme's ) . \\nthe movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity . \\n ( keep that in mind when planning your date . ) \\nthe stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme's stand-in makes his work no less impressive . \\nthere's only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies . \\nand lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action . \\nthe main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double-barreled points of view to make things run . \\ndon't get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo's hard-boiled , it's an amazing moment . \\nbut it's a moment that's hard to reproduce in hollywood . \\n ( for one thing , hollywood doesn't yet have chow yun-fat ! ) \\nwhile woo's hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture . \\nthe very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam's use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on . \\nthe film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam's shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action . \\nthe performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there's an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn't always overcome the limitations of its genre . \\nthe story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme's unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had . \\nbut it's not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it's doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity . \\nvan damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man's best movie , and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong/hollywood hybrid . \\n</th>\n",

       "      <th>you've heard all the hype . \\nyou've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker . \\nif you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy . \\nyou also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults . \\nbelieve the hype . \\nthe effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth . \\nbut there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy . \\nthe actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters . \\nthe most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence . \\nhe is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out . \\nportman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well . \\namidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . \\nand obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman . \\nhowever , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . \\nhe also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . \\nin fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film . \\ni would never call myself a \" star wars \" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . \\nhowever , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . \\nfor example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . \\nfor those of you not recently steeped in \" star wars \" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in \" return of the jedi \" and \" empire strikes back . \" \\nso , obviously , his appearance in \" phantom menace \" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . \\na lot of the movie is like that . \\nr2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . . \\nbecause he doesn't do much to add to it in any way . \\nsame goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . \\neven * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from \" empire strikes back \" ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in \" star wars \" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . \\nwhat's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? \\nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . \\nthere's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . \\nanother problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . \\ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . \\nand jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . \\nunlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles . \" \\nfurthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . \\noddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . \\nwell , he's done a good job . \\nthe hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . \\nthat's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . \\nthat's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . \\nwarning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! \\nin my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film . \\nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . \\nhe has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . \\nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . \\nhis explanation ? \\n \" his future is clouded . \" \\n ( warning : major spoiler ahead . \\nenter at your own risk . ) \\nof course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . \\nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . \\nbecause qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . \\nso , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker . \\ndid this story need to be told ? \\ni would say no . \\nbut is it a worthwhile movie to see ? \\nabsolutely . \\nif you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . \\nthe tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . \\nthe digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . \\nand yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . \\nabove all , this is a fun movie . \\nnot deep , not meaningful , and not profound . \\nbut fun . \\nmaybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed \" empire \" will direct . \\nbecause if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . \\n : ) \\n</th>\n",

the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . \\npullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . \\nben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . \\n \" i'll shoot you , \" he says to stark at one point . \\n \" i have a gun , and everything . \" \\nhis character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . \\no'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . \\ni find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . \\nkasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . \\nit's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times . \\nthere's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . \\nwhat we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . \\ni can't convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . \\nas a side note , i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . \\nthere was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . \\ni have a feeling the humor here won't appeal to everyone , but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest . \\njake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . \\ni found this out after seeing the film , and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . \\nhis direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . \\nzero effect is the kind of film that i'll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . \\nat the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . \\nand , with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future . \\n</th>\n",
